# This resource requires **gamebuild 2189 (Cayo Perico) or higher**, as the sp_manifest was taken from the **latest gamebuild.**

If you find any bugs, try noclipping or teleporting elsewhere, then coming back.

----------

You may find triathlon related scenarios in the following locations, I am yet to be able to delete/disable them, however if you somehow manage to, feel free to send me a pull request. The scenario files are as followed:

* alamo_sea

* del_perro_beach

* del_perro_carpark

* pacific_bluffs

* sandy_shores

* senora_hill

* vespucci

* vespucci_beach_north

* vespucci_beach_south

* vespucci_police_dept

* vinewood

----------


This is by all means a "work in progress" release, and is a test of my abilities streaming and overriding scenarios in FiveM.

If you would like to addon to this resource and modify existing scenarios in the world, open the `sp_manifest.ymt` file and rename the scenario to

`<Name>compcache:/server_scenarios/xxxxxxx</Name>` If you rename the resource, you will need to rename `server_scenarios`

For example, `<Name>compcache:/nopixel_scenarios/downtown</Name>`.

----------

# Installation ‚öôÔ∏è:


The resource and the scenarios must be in lowercase and must match what is written in the sp_manifest file.

* Download the resource and rename the folder to server_scenarios.

* Add `start server_scenarios` to your server.cfg

Again, if you rename the resource, you must change the file paths in the sp_manifest as stated above

----------

I have personally tested the following scenarios alongside this repository, and can confirm that they are working in FiveM after renaming them in the sp_manifest:
