# Server Scenarios

----------

Custom and modified scenarios for FiveM, replacing:

* alamo_sea
* bolingbroke_penitentiary
* del_perro_shops
* downtown
* farmers_market
* facility_main (requires bob74_ipl, places NPCs inside FIB facility)
* farmers_market
* lsia_terminal
* sandy_shores
* senora_hill
* stables (Martin Madrazo's Ranch)
* vinewood

----------

Stables scenario to work alongside https://github.com/TayMcKenzieNZ/Ranch-De-Caniche and https://github.com/TayMcKenzieNZ/fivem-scenarios

----------

This resource requires **gamebuild 2189 (Cayo Perico) or higher**, as the sp_manifest was taken from the **latest gamebuild.**

If you find any bugs, try noclipping or teleporting elsewhere, then coming back.

----------

I have tried my best to remove triathlon, cheering, clapping, and paparazzi related scenarios in the following locations, however if you happen to find some, feel free to send me a pull request. The scenario files are as followed:

* alamo_sea

* del_perro_beach

* del_perro_carpark

* pacific_bluffs

* sandy_shores

* senora_hill

* vespucci

* vespucci_beach_north

* vespucci_beach_south

* vespucci_police_dept

* vinewood

----------


This is by all means a "work in progress" release, and is a test of my abilities streaming and overriding scenarios in FiveM.

If you would like to addon to this resource and modify existing scenarios in the world, open the `sp_manifest.ymt` file and rename the scenario to

`<Name>compcache:/server_scenarios/xxxxxxx</Name>` If you rename the resource, you will need to rename `server_scenarios`

For example, `<Name>compcache:/nopixel_scenarios/downtown</Name>`.


The resource and the scenarios must be in lowercase.

I have personally tested the following scenarios alongside this repository, and can confirm that they are working in FiveM after renaming them in the sp_manifest:
