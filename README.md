# Ranch-Scenario


Custom Scenario for FiveM, replacing alamo_sea, downtown, farmers_market, sandy_shores, senora_hill, and stables (Martin Madrazo's Ranch)

Made to work alongside https://github.com/TayMcKenzieNZ/Ranch-De-Caniche and https://github.com/TayMcKenzieNZ/fivem-scenarios

This resource requires gamebuild 2189 (Cayo Perico) or higher, as the sp_manifest was taken from the latest gamebuild.

If you find any bugs, try noclipping or teleporting elsewhere, then coming back. 


This is by all means not the final product, and is a test of my abilities streaming and overriding scenarios in FiveM.

If you would like to addon to this resource and modify existing scenarios in the world, open the `sp_manifest.ymt` file and rename the scenario to

`<Name>compcache:/server_scenarios/xxxxxxx</Name>` If you rename the resource, you will need to rename `server_scenarios`

I have personally tested the following scenarios alongside this repository, and can confirm that they are working in FiveM after renaming them in the sp_manifest:
